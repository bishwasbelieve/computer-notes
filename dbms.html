        <h1>DBMS Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DBMS</strong> stands for <em>Database Management System</em>.</li>
            <li>It is software that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. DBMS acts as an interface between the database and end-users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.</li>
            <li>Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, IBM DB2, SQLite, MariaDB.</li>
            <li>Main functions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data storage, retrieval, and update: Efficiently stores large amounts of data and allows users to retrieve or modify it using queries.</li>
                    <li>User administration and security: Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions to ensure only authorized users can access or modify data.</li>
                    <li>Backup and recovery: Provides mechanisms to back up data and restore it in case of hardware failure, data corruption, or accidental deletion.</li>
                    <li>Data integrity management: Enforces rules to maintain accuracy and consistency of data, such as constraints and validation checks.</li>
                    <li>Concurrency control: Manages simultaneous data access by multiple users, preventing conflicts and ensuring data consistency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Types of DBMS:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hierarchical: Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.</li>
                    <li>Network: Allows more complex relationships with a graph structure, supporting many-to-many links.</li>
                    <li>Relational: Uses tables (relations) to store data, with relationships defined by keys. Most widely used model.</li>
                    <li>Object-oriented: Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming concepts.</li>
                    <li>Document-oriented: Stores, retrieves, and manages document-based information, e.g., MongoDB.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Advantages: Reduces data redundancy, improves data security, supports multi-user access, provides data abstraction, and ensures data independence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>Raw facts and figures without context, such as numbers, names, dates, or measurements. Data can be qualitative (descriptive, e.g., colors, labels) or quantitative (numeric, e.g., scores, amounts). By itself, data does not provide meaning or insight until it is processed, organized, or analyzed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Types of Data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Organized in a predefined format, such as tables or spreadsheets (e.g., databases, Excel files).</li>
                <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> Lacks a specific format or structure (e.g., emails, images, videos, social media posts).</li>
                <li><strong>Semi-structured Data:</strong> Contains both structured and unstructured elements (e.g., XML, JSON files).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Student names, exam scores, dates of birth, product prices, sensor readings.</li>
            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Data can be accurate or inaccurate, complete or incomplete, relevant or irrelevant, and timely or outdated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data is the foundation for generating information, which is achieved by processing, analyzing, and interpreting data to add context and meaning. Data alone has no meaning until it is organized or processed to become useful information. For example, a list of numbers is just data, but when those numbers represent monthly sales and are summarized, they become information that can guide business decisions.</p>
        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>Processed data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making. Information is created by organizing, structuring, or presenting data in a given context so that it becomes valuable to the user. For example, sales data processed to show monthly revenue trends, or exam scores averaged to determine class performance.</p>
        <h2>Features of Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Information should be correct and free from errors. Inaccurate information can lead to wrong decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Information should be available when needed. Outdated information may not be useful for current decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Information should be applicable to the current context or problem. Irrelevant information can cause confusion.</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> All necessary data should be present. Incomplete information can result in poor decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> Information should be brief but comprehensive, avoiding unnecessary details while covering all important aspects.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Information should not contradict itself. Consistent information builds trust and reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Information should be easily retrievable and understandable by authorized users.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Sensitive information should be protected from unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Database and its Purpose</h2>
        <p>A database is an organized collection of related data, typically stored and accessed electronically. Its purpose is to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data, supporting multiple users and applications. Databases help in reducing data redundancy, ensuring data integrity, and providing secure access to data. They allow for quick searching, sorting, updating, and reporting of data, making them essential for modern organizations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Databases support data sharing among multiple users and applications.</li>
            <li>They enforce data consistency and integrity through rules and constraints.</li>
            <li>Databases provide backup and recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss.</li>
            <li>They enable data security by controlling user access and permissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Terminologies in Database</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Table:</strong> Collection of related data in rows and columns, also called a relation. Each table represents an entity, such as "Students" or "Products".</li>
            <li><strong>Field (Attribute/Column):</strong> A column in a table; represents a data attribute, e.g., "Name" or "Age". Each field has a specific data type.</li>
            <li><strong>Record (Row/Tuple):</strong> A row in a table; represents a single data item, e.g., a student's details. Each record is a unique instance of the entity.</li>
            <li><strong>Tuple:</strong> Another term for a record (row). In relational databases, a tuple is an ordered set of values.</li>
            <li><strong>Object:</strong> An entity with data and behavior (in object-oriented databases). Objects encapsulate both state (data) and methods (behavior).</li>
            <li><strong>Keys:</strong> Attributes used to uniquely identify records (e.g., primary key, foreign key). Keys establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Key:</strong> A field or combination of fields that uniquely identifies each record in a table.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.</li>
            <li><strong>Schema:</strong> The structure that defines the organization of data in a database, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Instance:</strong> The actual content of the database at a particular moment. The schema is the design, while the instance is the data at a given time.</li>
            <li><strong>Entity:</strong> An object or thing in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects, represented as a table in a database.</li>
            <li><strong>Attribute:</strong> A property or characteristic of an entity, represented as a field in a table.</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> An association among two or more entities, often represented by foreign keys.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Dictionary</h2>
        <p>A data dictionary is a repository that stores definitions and descriptions of data elements in the database. It includes information such as data types, allowed values, default values, and relationships between tables. It helps in maintaining consistency and understanding the structure of the database.</p>
        <h2>Database Management System</h2> <br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A DBMS is software for creating and managing databases. It provides tools for defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among users and applications.</p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficient data storage and retrieval: Optimizes how data is stored and accessed.</li>
            <li>Data security and integrity: Protects data from unauthorized access and ensures accuracy.</li>
            <li>Support for multi-user environment: Allows concurrent access by multiple users without conflicts.</li>
            <li>Data independence: Changes in data structure do not affect application programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces data redundancy: Eliminates duplicate data by centralizing storage.</li>
            <li>Improves data sharing and security: Controls access and provides secure sharing among users.</li>
            <li>Ensures data consistency: Maintains uniformity and accuracy across the database.</li>
            <li>Facilitates backup and recovery: Simplifies data backup and restoration processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Complexity: Requires specialized knowledge to design and manage.</li>
            <li>High cost of hardware and software: Licensing and infrastructure can be expensive.</li>
            <li>Requires skilled personnel: Needs trained database administrators and developers.</li>
            <li>Performance overhead: Additional layers may slow down simple operations compared to file systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Database Model</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> Data organized in a tree-like structure. Each child has only one parent. Example: IBM IMS.</li>
            <li><strong>Network:</strong> Data organized in a graph, allowing many-to-many relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).</li>
            <li><strong>Relational:</strong> Data organized in tables with relationships between them. Uses SQL for queries. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.</li>
            <li><strong>Entity Relational:</strong> Uses ER diagrams to model data and relationships. ER diagrams help in designing the logical structure of databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-oriented:</strong> Data is stored as objects, supporting inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Example: db4o, ObjectDB.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Integrity Constraints and Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain Constraint:</strong> Restricts the data type and values for a field. For example, age must be an integer between 0 and 120.</li>
            <li><strong>Entity Constraint:</strong> Ensures each table has a primary key and unique records. No two rows can have the same primary key value.</li>
            <li><strong>Referential Constraint:</strong> Ensures foreign keys correctly reference primary keys in related tables, maintaining relationships between tables.</li>
            <li><strong>Keys:</strong> Used to uniquely identify records and establish relationships. Types include primary key, foreign key, candidate key, and super key.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Constraint:</strong> Ensures all values in a column are unique.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Null Constraint:</strong> Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Normalization</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing tables to eliminate data anomalies and ensure logical data storage.</p>
        <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1NF (First Normal Form):</strong> Ensures each column contains atomic values and each record is unique. No repeating groups or arrays.</li>
            <li><strong>2NF (Second Normal Form):</strong> Achieved when it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. Eliminates partial dependency.</li>
            <li><strong>3NF (Third Normal Form):</strong> Achieved when it is in 2NF and all attributes are only dependent on the primary key. Eliminates transitive dependency.</li>
            <li><strong>BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):</strong> A stricter version of 3NF, every determinant is a candidate key.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces data redundancy: Prevents duplicate data storage.</li>
            <li>Improves data consistency: Ensures data is updated in one place.</li>
            <li>Makes maintenance easier: Simplifies updates and modifications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can lead to complex queries: Data spread across multiple tables may require complex joins.</li>
            <li>May require more joins, affecting performance: Excessive normalization can slow down query performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Centralized and Distributed Database</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A centralized database stores all data in a single location, usually on a central server. A distributed database stores data across multiple sites connected by a network, with each site managing its own data and participating in global queries.</p>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> Easy to manage, better data consistency, simple backup and recovery, lower hardware costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Improved reliability, faster local access, scalable, supports data sharing across locations, fault tolerance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> Single point of failure, potential bottlenecks, limited scalability, higher risk of data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Complex management, data synchronization issues, higher setup and maintenance costs, network dependency.</li>
